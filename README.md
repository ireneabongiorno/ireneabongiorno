<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Irene Bongiorno</h1>
Known for being proactive and passionate in my work and always paying close attention to details. I thrive on challenges and working under pressure doesn’t intimidate me.
<br/><br/>
I’ve spent the last 8+ years collaborating across teams to bring digital solutions to life for clients like FC Barcelona, McDonald’s, and MediaMarkt, making a real impact for their brands and exceeding goals.
<br/><br/>
I’m ready for a role where I can keep learning, grow my skills, and work with up-to-date technologies. I can’t wait to tackle exciting projects and creative challenges.
<br/><br/>
‼️ Currently, I’m focused on learning more about web app development with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. I’d love to use this space to share what I’m learning and the challenges I run into along the way.
