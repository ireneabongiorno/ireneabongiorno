<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Irene Bongiorno</h1>
Known for being proactive and passionate in my work and always paying close attention to details. I thrive on challenges and working under pressure doesn’t intimidate me.<br/><br/>
I’ve spent the last 8+ years collaborating across teams to bring digital solutions to life for clients like FC Barcelona, McDonald’s and MediaMarkt, making a real impact for their brands and exceeding goals.<br/><br/>
I’m ready for a role where I can work with up-to-date technologies, keep learning and grow my skills. I can’t wait to tackle new projects and exciting challenges.<br/><br/>
‼️ Currently, I’m focused on learning more about web app development with JavaScript framework React. I’d love to use this space to share what I’m learning and the challenges I run into along the way.
